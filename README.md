# To-Do-Application

**📝 To-Do List Application (Java, OOP)**

This is a console-based To-Do List Application built using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The application allows users to add, view, and delete tasks using a simple Command Line Interface (CLI). It demonstrates core programming concepts like data structures, user input handling, validation, and modular design.

**✅ Features Implemented:-**
Task Addition: Users can enter and store tasks dynamically.

Task Viewing: Displays all added tasks in a numbered list.

Task Deletion: Allows users to delete tasks by entering the task number.

Input Validation: Ensures users enter valid numeric input for menu choices and deletion.

Data Structure Used: Utilizes Java’s ArrayList for flexible task storage.

Encapsulation & Modular Design: Each function (add, view, delete) is implemented as a separate method for clarity and maintainability.

Single-Class Structure: For simplicity, the main application logic and main() method are written in one class (TaskManager), making it easy to run and test.

**🛠️ Technologies Used:-**
Language: Java

Concepts: OOP (Encapsulation, Modular Design), CLI-based navigation, Input Validation

Data Structure: ArrayList

Tools: Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or terminal + javac compiler

**🚀 How to Run the Project:-**
1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Open TaskManager.java in your IDE or terminal.

3. Compile and run the file:
javac TaskManager.java
java ToDoApp.TaskManager
(Make sure you are in the correct ToDoApp package directory)
